              CHANGES - Changelog for GeSHi (geshi.php only)

Changes to the code are listed under the version they occured in, with who suggested
it by each one (if there's nobody listed as suggesting it I dreamed it up :)). Users
who suggested an idea often also provided the code that was used as a basis for the
changes - thanks to all who suggested these ideas and gave me the code to show me how!

Language files listed under each version were made by the author beside them, and then
modified by me for consistency/bug fixing.

Please send any bug reports to nigel@geshi.org, or use the bug report tracker
at sourceforge (http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=114997&atid=670231)

  -  Changed name of XML language to XML from HTML
  -  Removed min and max tab width checks

     special circumstances.
  -  Source is checked to make sure it is not empty else an error occurs
  -  Removed excess characters after ?> in ada.php, apache.php and cpp.php that caused
     http headers to be sent (psichron)

Version 1.0.5
  -  Added language files:
     * MPASM (Bakalex)
     * Oracle 8 (Guy Wicks)
  -  Fixed bug where not using an encoding type would sometime result in warnings (although
     there still seems to be issues with encoding in general that I'm trying to gather more
     data on) (Alexander Spennemann)
  -  Removed "margin: 0" from <ol> in an attempt to make line numbers visible in IE again
     by default (untested, but I don't really care if it works... get firefox! ;))
  -  Added note on php5 support (Karim Scheik)
  -  Added two new methods: load_from_file and get_language_name_from_extension, that can
     help automate file highlighting (though the extension array at this time is quite bare)
     (David Gartner, Brian Cheesman)

  -  Added method set_encoding that allows you to set the character
     set used by calls to htmlentities() in GeSHi
  -  You can now specify an array of object splitters, and each
     type of method separated by each object splitter can be highlighted
     differently
  -  If a language uses a case sensitive keyword group and that group
     has a URL associated with it, the keyword will not be lowercased
     in the URL (M. Uli Kusterer)

     from many languages(base script by Andreas Gohr, modified by Nigel McNie),
     and an example script (needs lotsa work...)

     (suggested by Andreas von Oettingen)

     Andreas von Oettingen)
  -  Getter available for human-readable language name (suggested by Simon Patterson)

  -  Contextual highlighting with <BEGIN GeSHi> ... <END GeSHi> in the code (which
     can be disabled)

     by cybot_tm). Also thanks to Marcin Gryszkalis for the links for C, Java
     and Perl.
  -  Code can have a header and footer
  -  Time taken to parse the code is recorded and made available with the get_time()
     method
  -  error() now returns a human-readable error message
  -  Function geshi_highlight added to make it even easier to highlight on the fly
  -  Advanced regular expression handling
  -  Bug fixes to lexic_permission handling

Version 1.0.1
  -  Added methods set_symbols_style() and set_symbols_highlighting(). These should be used
     instead of set_brackets_style and set_brackets_highlighting respectively.
  -  Added a new field - language_path - that can be set either when the constructor is
     called, or by the new method set_language_path(), that specifies a path to the directory
     containing the language files (bug reported by bbspliff)
  -  Added a new method set_case_keywords(), that allows the auto-casing feature to be
     changed on the fly instead of simply being specified in the language file
  -  If there is an error the source that is outputted is now handled much better
  -  Lines are broken in the source only by \n now, not by \r\n (to save on output source)
  -  Indentation moved into its own method
  -  Method header() modified to allow the user to choose whether the code is surrounded in
     a <div> or a <pre> (see documentation for benefits of both). Method footer() likewise
     modified.
  -  Method get_stylesheet() modified so that a smaller comment is outputted in economy mode,
     and bugs with when line number classes are outputted in economy mode have been fixed
  -  Bug where spans had two quotes at the end of the attributes fixed (ie. <span style=".."">)
  -  Added language files:
     * Ada (Tux)
     * Apache log file (Tux)
     * ASM (Tux)
     * NSIS (Tux)
     * Pascal (Tux)
